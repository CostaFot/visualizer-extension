.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a self-signed code signing certificate for MSIX sideload releases.

.DESCRIPTION
    Creates a certificate matching the Publisher in Package.appxmanifest,
    exports it as a PFX, and copies the base64-encoded value to the clipboard
    ready to paste as the SIGNING_CERT_PFX GitHub secret.

    NOTE: this project shares its Publisher CN with AgentsPanelExtension — if you already
    have that signing.pfx, reuse it instead of generating a new certificate.

.PARAMETER Password
    Password to protect the PFX file. Also goes into the SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD secret.

.PARAMETER OutFile
    Path to write the PFX file. Defaults to signing.pfx next to this script.

.EXAMPLE
    .\create-signing-cert.ps1 -Password "hunter2"
